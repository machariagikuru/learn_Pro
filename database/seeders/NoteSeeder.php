### What Are Poetic Devices?

**Poetic devices** are tools poets use to enhance the meaning, sound, and impact of their poems. Some common ones include:

1. **Alliteration** â€“ Repetition of initial consonant sounds:  
   _"She sells sea shells by the seashore."_

2. **Simile** â€“ Comparison using 'like' or 'as':  
   _"Her eyes were like stars."_

3. **Metaphor** â€“ Direct comparison without 'like' or 'as':  
   _"Time is a thief."_

4. **Personification** â€“ Giving human traits to non-human things:  
   _"The wind whispered through the trees."_

5. **Imagery** â€“ Use of vivid descriptions to appeal to senses:  
   _"The golden sun poured through the dusty window."_

### Why They Matter

Poetic devices help:
- Create rhythm and musicality
- Enhance imagery and mood
- Convey deeper meanings

        $pronunciation = SubStrand::where('slug', 'pronunciation')->first();

            'content' => <<<EOT
### Why Pronunciation Matters

Pronunciation affects how clearly you communicate. Proper pronunciation improves comprehension, credibility, and fluency in speech.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Syllables**: Words are broken into syllables.  
   E.g., _com/pu/ter_ has 3 syllables.

2. **Stress**: One syllable is more prominent than others.  
   E.g., _PHOtograph_, phoTOgrapher, photoGRAphic

3. **Intonation**: The rise and fall of voice tone.  
   - Rising for yes/no questions: _"Are you okay?"_  
   - Falling for statements: _"Iâ€™m fine."_

4. **Consonant & Vowel Sounds**:  
   Master individual sounds to avoid confusion (e.g., /l/ vs /r/).

### Exercises:

- Record yourself reading aloud.
- Listen to BBC Learning English or TED Talks.
- Practice tongue twisters:  
  _"Red lorry, yellow lorry."_
